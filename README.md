Final Project C++ Code for CS111
by Jordan Viramontes

In this project, we discuss the history and usage of the Diffie-Hellman encryption algorithm. This repository is a hosting spot for my code that implements the encryption method.

To input your own variables into the code, follow this syntax in the command code:

./a.exe 33 8 3 2
in order, each argument is: public key 1, public key 2, private key 1, private key 2.
